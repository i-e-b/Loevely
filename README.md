# Survivor

What happens when you mix pac-man and snake, then add zombies?

# NOTE:

This was built for Love2D `0.10.0`. It works with 11.2, but not perfectly. It needs *all* the colors to be changed from 0-255 range to 0-1 range.


## Things to change for difficulty:

* Speed
* Level design (incl z count)
* Follow radius
* Path finding
* Eaten survivors turn into zombie <-- I like this one
* Fed zombies get quicker
* minimum survivor save
